# Ariehm Helloworld

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install ariehm/helloworld/<formula>`

Or `brew tap ariehm/helloworld` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).

## How did this get here?

I'm pretty sure I created the base repo structure with:

```
brew tap-new ariehm/helloworld
```

That created a folder with stuff in it under:
```
/opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/ariehm/homebrew-helloworld
```

I then made this repo (bare, with no files in it, no README, nothing).

Then I `cd`'d into that folder (`/opt/homebrew...`) and added the Github repo as a remote, and then committed and pushed out the initial files.

The rest is, as they say, (git) history!
